          Say Y or M if you want to add support for codecs attached to 
          the AT32 SSC interface.  You will also need to
          to select the audio interfaces to support below.

          on the LRS PlayPaq.

          Say Y if you want to run with the AT32 SSC generating the BCLK
          and FRAME signals on the PlayPaq.  Unless you want to play
          with the AT32 as the SSC master, you probably want to say N here,
          as this will give you better sound quality.
