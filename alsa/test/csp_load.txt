csp_load.c:

  This is a source file for simple CSP microcode loader for Sound Blaster 16ASP and some 
Sound Blaster AWE32 sound cards with Creative Signal Processor (CSP) chip (CT1748A) installed.
It can also be used as post-install function for snd-sb16-csp module to load default codec at
module installation. If CSP chip is succesfully detected and initialized, it will be installed
as a hardware dependant device hwC0D2 into /dev/snd directory. 'csp_load' executable can be
compiled with 'make csp_load' command in alsa-driver/test directory. 

  If Sound Blaster 16ASP card name is 'card1', then status of CSP chip can be read from
/proc/asound/card1/sb-16csp file. After initialization, this file will show:

Creative Signal Processor [v1.0]
State: -x---

  It is possible to load hardware codecs, supplied with your SB16ASP Windows drivers now.
Currently, only following codec can be loaded to CSP device:
  -wfm0001a.csp: QSound codec

Codecs, which will be supported in future:
  -wfm0006a.csp: A-law codec
  -wfm0007a.csp: u-law codec
  -wfm0011a.csp: IMA ADPCM codec

These codecs won't be supported by ALSA:
  -wfm0200a.csp: Creative ADPCM codec
  -wfm0201a.csp: Text2Speech
  -wfm0202a.csp: Fast Speech 8 codec
  -wfm0203a.csp: Fast Speech 10 codec

  To load for example function #2 from QSound codec file (this works for my CSP v1.0), you should type: 
'./csp_load wfm0001a.csp 2'. Usually, there are 1 - 4 functions present in each CSP micrcode file,
they can be different codecs for different CSP hardware versions, or one function for hardware coder 
and the other for hardware decoder. After successful loading, /proc/asound/card1/sb16-csp will show:

Creative Signal Processor [v1.0]
State: -x--L
Codec loaded: QSOUND [func #2]
PCM Formats supported: 0x18 [mono/stereo] [Q/-/W]

  With QSound effect microcode loaded, all supported file formats can be played with QSound 180 degree
positioning applied.

  QSound element is integrated into mixer structure as 3D Effect1 - space element, but it will be only
shown if CSP chip has been found and support for CSP was compiled into ALSA drivers. When enabled, QSound
position can be dynamically changed by mixer slider position, and proc interface will follow the state
of CSP chip and its current QSound position:

Creative Signal Processor [v1.0]
State: Qx-RL
Codec loaded: QSOUND [func #2]
PCM Formats supported: 0x18 [mono/stereo] [Q/-/W]
Running PCM format: 0x10 [mono]
Qsound: left = 0x9, right = 0x9

  All CSP functions can also be accessed by IOCTL interface.
