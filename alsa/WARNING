WARNING!!! Mixer channels for ALSA driver are muted by default!!!
*****************************************************************
Some soundcards (like GUS MAX/PnP, OAK Mozart), supports hardware muting
and this muting should be turned off only with these ways:

1. ALSA native (not OSS) mixers:
   Look for alsa-lib and alsa-utils packages for amixer and alsamixer...
2. You can edit of output from /proc/sound/0/mixer0 file and remove
   words lmute and rmute by selected channel. Write back changes to
   same file...
