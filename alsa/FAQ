		==========================================
	             FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Driver is installed and sucessfully loaded in kernel, but it doesn't
   produce any sound. What's wrong?
A: You should raise volume for mixer channels and/or unmute mixer channels.
   Look for alsa-utils package at http://alsa.jcu.cz where are native mixers.

Q: Can I verify without native mixer program if outputs for card are muted?
A: Yes. You can do 'cat /proc/asound/0/mixer0'. If this command shows words
   like 'lmute' and 'rmute' by selected channels - mute is on.

Q: How can I store and restore mixer settings?
A: Use some native mixer program (for example amixer) or you can do simply
   'cat /proc/asound/#/mixer0 > file' where # is soundcard number. To restore
   use opposite way 'cat file > /proc/asound/#/mixer0'.

Q: Driver is working (mixer at least), but OSS programs says: Can't open
   /dev/dsp. What's wrong?
A: OSS compatible PCM (digital audio) emulation comes as add-on module which
   isn't loaded by default. If you have modified /etc/conf.module as suggested
   in INSTALL, it should be loaded with kerneld or kmod. Check it - if this
   method for some reason doesn't work - you need insert 'snd-pcm1-oss' module
   manualy.

Q: Can I specify which DMA channel will be used for some direction for
   Sound Blaster 16/AWE soundcards?
A: Yes, you can change default settings (which is auto) over /proc filesystem.
   'echo "Playback 16" > /proc/asound/#/sb16' specifies that 16-bit DMA channel
   will be used for playback. Opposite 'echo "Record 16" > /proc/asound' speci-
   fies that 16-bit DMA channel will be used for record. To return to default
   state you should use 'echo "Playback auto" > /proc/asound/#/sb16'. You can
   also check current settings and status by command 'cat /proc/asound/#/sb16'.

Q: I have Plug and Play soundcard, but ALSA driver doesn't detect it.
   What's wrong?
A: Plug and Play soundcards should be initialized with isapnp utility
   at first (can be found in isapnptools package).
