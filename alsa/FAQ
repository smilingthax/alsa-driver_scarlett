		Advanced Linux Sound Architecture - Driver
		==========================================
	             FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

Q: The driver is installed and sucessfully loaded in the runtime kernel,
   but it does not produce any sound. What's wrong?
A: You should raise the volume for mixer channels and/or unmute mixer channels.
   Look for the alsa-utils package at http://www.alsa-project.org. There are
   native mixers.

Q: How can I store and restore mixer settings?
A: Use the native alsactl program (strongly preffered) or an another ALSA mixer
   program.

Q: The driver is loaded, but OSS programs say: Can't open /dev/mixer.
   What is wrong?
A: The OSS compatible mixer emulation comes as an add-on module which is not
   loaded by default. If you have got modified /etc/conf.module as suggested
   in the INSTALL file, it should be loaded with kerneld or kmod. Check it -
   if this method for some reason doesn't work - you need to insert
   the 'snd-mixer-oss' module manualy.

Q: The driver is loaded, but OSS programs say: Can't open /dev/dsp.
   What is wrong?
A: The OSS compatible PCM (digital audio) emulation comes as an add-on module
   which is not loaded by default. If you have got modified /etc/conf.module
   as suggested in the INSTALL file, it should be loaded with kerneld or kmod.
   Check it - if this method for some reason doesn't work - you need to insert
   the 'snd-pcm1-oss' module manualy.

Q: Can I specify which DMA channel will be used for a specific direction with
   Sound Blaster 16/AWE soundcards?
A: Yes, you may change the default settings (which is auto) over the /proc
   interface. Look to the INSTALL file for more details.

Q: Noises in X-win?
A: Try comment out line in your XF86Config file:
   #Option "pci_retry"    # faster, but problematic for ISA DMA
