The alsa-drivers in this package are designed for the following kernels:

 - Vanilla 3.0 to 3.2
 - Vanilla 2.6.18 to 2.6.39

It's not guaranteed that they work with any newer version than above
or modified kernels by distributors.

It might be eventually possible to build the alsa-drivers with older
modified kernels by distributors (2.6.9+). These kernels have backported
many things from more recent vanilla kernels.
