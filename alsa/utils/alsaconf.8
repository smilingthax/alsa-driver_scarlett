.SH NAME
alsaconf \- configuration tool for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B alsaconf
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B alsaconf
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
\fBAlsaconf\fP is a simple shell script which tries to detect the sound cards
on your system and writes a suitable configuration file for ALSA. It will try
to guess what GNU/Linux distribution you're running, and will act accordingly
to the standards of that distribution, if specific support is available.
.PP
Alsaconf will write a modutils snippet which can be then used by modutils
to load the correct parameters for your sound card.
