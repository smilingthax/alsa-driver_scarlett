		Sound Blaster Live mixer / default DSP code
		===========================================


The EMU10K1 chips have the DSP part which can be programmed to support
various sample processing. This acticle does not describe the overall
functionality of the EMU10K1 chips. See the manuals section for further
details. The ALSA driver programs this portion of chip by default code
(can be altered later) which offers this kind of functionality:


1) IEC958 (S/PDIF) raw PCM
--------------------------

This PCM device (it's 3rd PCM device for given card and first (0) subdevice)
allows to forward 48kHz, stereo, 16-bit little endian stream without any
modifications to the digital output (coaxial or digital). The universal
interface allows creation up to 8 raw PCM devices operating at 48kHz,
16-bit little endian. It could be easy to add support for multichannel
devices to the current code, but the conversion routines exist only for
stereo (2-channel streams) at the time. Look to tram_poke routines in
lowlevel/emu10k1/emufx.c for more details.


2) Digital mixer controls
-------------------------

These controls are built using the DSP instructions. They offer extended
functionality. Only the default build-in code in the ALSA driver is described
here.

name='Wave Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 0 and 1 for left and right PCM samples.
The result samples are forwarded to the front DAC PCM slots of the AC'97 codec.

name='Wave Surround Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 0 and 1 for left and right PCM samples.
The result samples are forwarded to the rear I2S DACs. These DACs separates
separately (they are not inside the AC'97 codec).

name='Wave Center Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 0 and 1 for left and right PCM samples.
The result is converted to single channel (mono) and forwarded to the ??rear??
right DAC PCM slot of the AC'97 codec.

name='Wave LFE Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 0 and 1 for left and right PCM.
The result is converted to single channel (mono) and forwarded to the ??rear??
left DAC PCM slot of the AC'97 codec.

name='Wave Capture Volume',index=0
name='Wave Capture Switch',index=0

These controls are used to attenuate samples for left and right PCM FX-bus
accumulator. ALSA uses accumulators 0 and 1 for left and right PCM.
The result is forwared to the ADC capture FIFO (thus to the standard capture
PCM device).

name='Music Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right MIDI FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 4 and 5 for left and right MIDI samples.
The result samples are forwarded to the front DAC PCM slots of the AC'97 codec.

name='Music Capture Volume',index=0
name='Music Capture Switch',index=0

These controls are used to attenuate samples for left and right MIDI FX-bus
accumulator. ALSA uses accumulators 4 and 5 for left and right PCM.
The result is forwared to the ADC capture FIFO (thus to the standard capture
PCM device).

name='Surround Digital Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right rear PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 2 and 3 for left and right rear PCM samples.
The result samples are forwarded to the rear I2S DACs. These DACs separates
separately (they are not inside the AC'97 codec).

name='Surround Digital Capture Volume',index=0
name='Surround Digital Capture Switch',index=0

Thes controls are used to attenuate samples for left and right rear PCM FX-bus
accumulator. ALSA uses accumulators 2 and 3 for left and right rear PCM samples.
The result is forwared to the ADC capture FIFO (thus to the standard capture
PCM device).

name='Center Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate sample for center PCM FX-bus accumulator.
ALSA uses accumulator 6 for center PCM sample. The result sample is forwarded
to the ??rear?? right DAC PCM slot of the AC'97 codec.

name='LFE Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate sample for center PCM FX-bus accumulator.
ALSA uses accumulator 6 for center PCM sample. The result sample is forwarded
to the ??rear?? left DAC PCM slot of the AC'97 codec.

name='AC'97 Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right front ADC PCM slots
of the AC'97 codec. The result samples are forwarded to the front DAC PCM
slots of the AC'97 codec. Note: This control should be zero for the standard
operations, otherwise an digital loopback is activated.

name='AC'97 Capture Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right front ADC PCM slots
of the AC'97 codec. The result is forwared to the ADC capture FIFO (thus to
the standard capture PCM device). Note: This control should be 100 (maximal
value), otherwise no analog inputs of the AC'97 codec can be captured
(recorded).

name='IEC958 TTL Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right IEC958 TTL
digital inputs (usually used by a CDROM drive). The result samples are
forwarded to the front DAC PCM slots of the AC'97 codec.

name='IEC958 TTL Capture Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right IEC958 TTL
digital inputs (usually used by a CDROM drive). The result samples are
forwared to the ADC capture FIFO (thus to the standard capture PCM device).

name='Zoom Video Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right zoom video
digital inputs (usually used by a CDROM drive). The result samples are
forwarded to the front DAC PCM slots of the AC'97 codec.

name='Zoom Video Capture Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right zoom video
digital inputs (usually used by a CDROM drive). The result samples are
forwared to the ADC capture FIFO (thus to the standard capture PCM device).

name='IEC958 Optical Playback Volume',index=0

digital input. The result samples are forwarded to the front DAC PCM slots
of the AC'97 codec.

name='IEC958 Optical Capture Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right IEC958 optical
digital inputs. The result samples are forwared to the ADC capture FIFO
(thus to the standard capture PCM device).

name='IEC958 Coaxial Playback Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right IEC958 coaxial
digital inputs. The result samples are forwarded to the front DAC PCM slots
of the AC'97 codec.

name='IEC958 Coaxial Capture Volume',index=0

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right IEC958 coaxial
digital inputs. The result samples are forwared to the ADC capture FIFO
(thus to the standard capture PCM device).

name='Line LiveDrive Playback Volume',index=0
name='Line LiveDrive Playback Volume',index=1

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right I2S ADC
inputs (on the LiveDrive). The result samples are forwarded to the front
DAC PCM slots of the AC'97 codec.

name='Line LiveDrive Capture Volume',index=0
name='Line LiveDrive Playback Volume',index=1

This control is used to attenuate samples for left and right I2S ADC
inputs (on the LiveDrive). The result samples are

and center / LFE outputs are affected.

name='Tone Control - Bass',index=0

This control sets the bass intensity.

name='Tone Control - Treble',index=0

This control sets the treble intensity.

name='IEC958 Optical Raw Playback Switch',index=0

If this switch is on, then the samples for the IEC958 digital output are
taken only from the raw FX8010 PCM, otherwise standard front PCM samples
are taken.

name='Headphone Playback Volume',index=1

This control attenuates the samples for the headphone output.

name='Headphone Center Playback Switch',index=1

If this switch is on, then the sample for the center PCM is put to the
left headphone output (useful for SB Live cards without separate center/LFE
output).

name='Headphone LFE Playback Switch',index=1
