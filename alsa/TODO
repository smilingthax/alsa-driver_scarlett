- midlevel:
H change defaults for Wave volume and DAC/ADC volume
H Implement correctly ready_mode
H fix BOGUS use of sleep_on!!! (Jaroslav)
H better solution for OSS mmap automatic frame_data update (for cards like cs461x)
M add schedule call in all loop that may last more than 1 ms (search udelay/mdelay)
M add master/divisor to timer
L lock, grant and revoke ioctls (not available to application I propose)
L change functions to not use hw data directly but info obtained with snd_pcm_params_info 
L make xrun detection optional (Abramo)
L nonblocking async mode (with requests queue)
L check multithread safeness wrt at least read/write
L async notification support (To think)
L extend the use of __init and __exit to all initialization code wherever it is
L clean endianness stuff
L partial PCM mmap support (rme9652)

- lowlevel:
M reduce prepare path (a lot of stuff may be moved to params ioctl) for faster xrun recovery
M add detailed failure to params ioctl (see es18xx)
M add needed callbacks for params_info (see es18xx)
M change real rate params to use snd_pcm_clock_* (where useful) and to set rate_{master,divisor} (see es18xx)
M fix es1968 driver to compute real rate at params time
M add new MPU401 uart driver (Jaroslav)
L ICE1712 - fix consumer part PCM/AC'97 code - Hoontech Envy24 DSP (Jaroslav)
L Trident 2 frags problem (Jaroslav)
L rewrite CMI8330 PCM part
L separate chip structure from pcm device
L get rid of snd_pcm_lib_fragment_bytes and snd_pcm_lib_buffer_bytes
L optimize lowlevel drivers for frame unit use
