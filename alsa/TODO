- midlevel:
H remove *fallback memory allocation functions once the hw_params stuff is finished
H change defaults for Wave volume and DAC/ADC volume
H add nonblock ioctl for rawmidi
M add schedule call in all loop that may last more than 1 ms (search udelay/mdelay)
M add master/divisor to timer
M add configuration parser for OSS PCM (and perhaps mixer) emulation code
M add the __setup code to all modules (including midlevel ones)
L lock, grant and revoke ioctls (not available to application I propose)
L nonblocking async mode (with requests queue)
L check multithread safeness wrt at least read/write
L extend the use of __init and __exit to all initialization code wherever it is
L clean endianness stuff
L add work_ptr (to think about)

- lowlevel:
M create an USB audio driver
M reduce prepare path (a lot of stuff may be moved to hw_params) for faster xrun recovery
L ICE1712 - fix consumer part PCM/AC'97 code - Hoontech Envy24 DSP (Jaroslav)
L CS4236 - test the half duplex (one DMA) settings
L rewrite CMI8330 PCM part
L separate chip structure from pcm device
L get rid of snd_pcm_lib_period_bytes and snd_pcm_lib_buffer_bytes
L optimize lowlevel drivers for frame unit use
