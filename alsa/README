Notes to soundcards
===================

Sound Blaster 16/AWE
--------------------
    Quake and other OSS/Lite programs should abort with 'Segmentation
fault' or other errors. This is due to ALSA driver isn't able support
8-bit or 16-bit sample wide for mmaped (direct) access at some time 
(this depends if some other application isn't using record or playback
direction). For normal access ALSA driver does sample width conversions.
You can try use different sample width for these programs.
